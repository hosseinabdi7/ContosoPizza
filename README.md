# ContosoPizza
### creating a cross-platform RESTful Service using Asp.net Core Web API Controllers with C# and .NET.

# **Example Scenario**

Suppose you're an employee of a pizza company named Contoso Pizza. Your manager has asked you to develop a RESTful pizza inventory management service as a prerequisite for the company's web storefront and mobile application. The service has to support adding, viewing, modifying, and removing types of pizzaâ€” a standardized usage of HTTP action verbs better known as Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD).

# What will we be doing?
you'll create a new web API application using ASP.NET Core, and how to run and test it from the command line. Then, you'll add a data store and a new API controller. Finally, you'll implement and test the API methods to create, read, update, and delete pizzas from the data store.

# What is the main goal?
you'll be able to create new web API applications with ASP.NET Core, and to create API controllers that implement basic CRUD logic.
